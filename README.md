This repository was created due to the need for a standard interface that all dividend paying tokens implement.
While there are other projects currently in existence they all have one critical flaw, token holders cannot delegate the dividends yielded by their tokens to other addresses.
This project attempts to succeed where others have fallen short.

The benefit of allowing delegation of yield to other addresses is immense.
Perhaps the most important role that this will play is to allow users to deposit coins that return dividends in smart contracts without having to forfeit the yield offered by their tokens.
We believe that this project may allow for more mature and efficient markets.

This repository contains three contracts the first being a standard ERC20 interface, the second being a yield interface and the third being an implementation of both the yield and ERC20 interfaces
